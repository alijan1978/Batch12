Recap from Inheritance in Java:

Inheritance: It's a mechanism in java through which a child calls gets the properties and methods from a parent class.

Benefits of inheritance:
- Saves time to code
- code duplication is reduced
- execution time is faster

Disadvantages:
- classes are tightly coupled, if we change something in parent class it is also changed in the child class.

Types of Inheritance:
We have 4 types of Inheritance, but Java only supports 3 of them.
1. Single
2. Hierarical
3. Multi-level
4. Multiple (NOT supported in Java)

Single Inheritance:
In single inheritance, we have only one child and one parent class OR only two classes participate in Inheritance.
one as child and one as parent. EXAMPLE:

Class Parent {
}
class Child extends Parent{
}

Hierarical Inheritance:
In Hierarical inheritance, we have a single parent class and multiple child classes. EXAMPLE:

Class parent {
}
class Child1 extends Parent{
}
class Child2 extends Parent{
}

Multi-level Inheritance:
We have Multiple levels of Inheritance, for exampe if we have classes A B C. Class C will be inherited from B and B
will be inherited from A. EXAMPLE:

Class A{
}
Class B extends A{
}
Class C extends B{
}

Super Keyword:

Super keyword is like the "this" keyword, which refers to the Parent class object. For example:
We can access the fields, methods OR constructors of parent class inside the child class using "this" keyword.
