Review Class with Sohail:
3/3/2022

What is class?
whenever we create a code, there is an intention behind it, we have to achieve our motive when we execute it.
To run or execute the code, we need some certain things, we need functionality, lots of factors to acheive one goal.
to put all things in a single place is called CLASS.
Fields, variables, constructors, Loops, etc... all we type and put all these things in single things are called CLASS.

When it comes to technical definition: definition, explanation, implementation and execution.

We call it a template, or blueprint, or logical entity to include all these information and retrive these motive
or the target and that is an OBJECT. to make one practical proterty, we need to call it OBJECT Oriented programming language.
everything is surrounded by Object.

What is Object:

We have lots of things in class, we need one point to access to those information
or to a elements, or fields of that specific class is called Object.
Object always takes care of these two things:

 1. State 2. Behavior.

State:
Attribute,

Bhavior:
You want to perform an action, then you provide those entity to

when we want to access the object,
Why we can't directly interact with the Class?
but it will be one time interaction face to face, BUT if you interact through Object then you can interact multiple time, things.

Now the requirement of business Market is Dynamic and we change some things according to the requirement.
