Difference between Instance variable and Static variable:

Static belongs to a class, it is initialized only once. no need to create an object.

Instance Example:

Name , Lastname, speciality of docotors.... comes under Instance... as many class we can create.
then we can able to create object for each. we instantiate their variables. a copy of the variable will be shared
to all objects.


Hospital should be Static
