Recap from Class 18 --> Access Modifiers kn Java:

Access modifiers allow us to control the visibility of class members (fields, methods, constructors & ets...)
and class itself in Java.
There are 4 access levels and there are 3 keywords that we define these access level fourth level is applier  when
we don't use any access modifier keyword. Levels from most restricted to less restricted are -->Private and then we have
-->default --> then protected --> and -->public.

1. private :  it is Keyword means as private.
2. default: Not keyword, means default access level...default means visible inside one package
3.protected: Keyword is also keyword ...protected visible  between packages
4.public: it is keyword

Rules:
(1) We should always prefer private access modifier for the fields. because fields contain the data and the methods of
your class might use that data to perform some tasks if we dont perform sanity checks before setting the values
to these fields, our classes and methods might misbehave also the access of the data should be restricted so that
not every one can access the data.
(2) We can't use access modifiers with local variables.

*********************************************
New Lesson --> Constructor

Constructors in Java allows us to set the values of the fields of a class. It is a block of code.
