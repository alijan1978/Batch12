Recap of Constructor in java:

constructors in java special block of code similar to methods that initialize the objects of a class.
Rules:
1. They dont have return types not even void
2. name of the constructor must be the same as name of the class
3. Constructors can't have non access modifiers like static final etc.
4. We can use the access modifiers like public, private, protected with constructors.
5. If we don't write a constructor in a class, a default constructor is provided by compiler
6. We  can have multiple constructors in a class, but their number of arguments sequence of argument or type of arguments should differents
7. if we have multiple constructors then Java decide which constructor to call based on the parameters we pass.

Compiler : translate our code to bytecode so that JVM understands it...then JVM converts bytecode to machine-specific code.

this keyword:
it is a reserved keyword in java that we can use to refer to instance variables, methods, or constructors of a class.

1. "this keyword" is used to distinguish instance variables with local variables
2. We can use "this keyword" to call the constructor of a class inside another class
3. We can use "this keyword" to call the methods of a class

Rules:
1. this( ) : should be the first line inside a constructor
2. this( ): can't be used inside methods

Inheritance Lesson:

Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship, also known as parent-child relationship. (from the same type).
