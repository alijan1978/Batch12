Access Modifiers:

Access modifiers are keywords in java that defines from where a certain variable, method or a class etc can be accessed.
There are 4 types of access modifiers in Java that we can define using three keywords:
1. Private
2. Protected
3. Public

Types of access are four:
1. Private
2. Default (applied when no keyword is used)
3. Protected
4. Public private access (keyword is private):
when we use the private keyword with any of the variables, methods or classes these default access
(applied when we don't use any keyword):
When we don't use any of the keywords default access is applied by Java to those variables methods or classes etc.
which means these things can only be accessed from the same package.

Protected access are the one (we use the protected class):
when protected access is applied, class members (variables methods etc.) can be accessed from other packages,
but only in the classes that participate in inheritance.

Public access (Public keyword):

Public means, class members and classes can be accessed from anywhere inside that project.
