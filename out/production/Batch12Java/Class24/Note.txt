Recap: Method Overriding in Java:

Method overriding happens when we have same name methods in parent and child class classes.

Benefits:
1. Flexibility, if we don't like something from the parent class, we dont override it and can provide our own implemnentation.
2. Same method can act differently depending upon the object on which we call it.

Rules:

1. without inheritance method overriding is not possible.
2. Method signature should be same in parent class and in child class.
3. If something does not participate in inheritance , we cannot override it, like constructors and private methods.
4. We can increase the visibility in the child class, but we cannot decrease it. for example, we go from default or protected
    to public, but we cannot do the reverse.
5. We cannot override a static method, but we can redeclare it.
    For example, main method can't be overridden as it is static.
6. We can't have different return type in the child class, it must be the same as of parent class.
