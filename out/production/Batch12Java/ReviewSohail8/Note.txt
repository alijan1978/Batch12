String:

String is a collection of characters and each character has specific index position.

We mostly use String 99.9 % in daily life and real world job.
String manipulation, declare string, add string, ...
if you work on Word Doc or Excel sheet, username, password, Test Cases in work, its all String format parameter.
So, its very important to learn better String. No String, No Testing.
