========================================

Map is an interface that allows us to store the data in key value pairs.

Benefits:
1. We can store two values inside the maps
2. Searching is very efficient in maps

Three Types of Maps:
1. HashMap -- 2. LinkedHashMap -- 3. TreeMap

HashMap:
   - Insertion order is not maintained (downside)
   - Insertion and retrieval is fastest (upside)

LinkedHashmap:
   - Insertion order is maintained (upside)
   - Insertion speed is same as HashMap, but retrieval speed is slowest

TreeMap:
    - Data is sorted in natural order by default
    - Insertion speed is slowest, but retrieval speed is better than LinkedHashMap... but slower than HashMap

RULES:
- We cannot convert a collection to a Map... for example: we cannot convert a set to a Map.

       Map<String,String> students = new Map<>()
       students.put("Mohammad123", "Mohammad");
       Set<String> set = new HashSet();
