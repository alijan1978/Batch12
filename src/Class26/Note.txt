Recap: Abstraction in Java:

Hiding the implementation details and providing the functionality only.
Two methods to achieve abstraction:

1. Abstract classes
2. Interfaces

Abstract classes are with abstract keyword.
Interfaces are the contracts that we create with the help fo interface keyword.

How to decide which one to use:
1. Prefer the interfaces over abstract classes.
2. If two or more classes are closely related to each other, go with abstract classes.
For exampe: if we have to create a Lion class and a Horse class, we should go with abstract classes and
            should create an animal abstract class.
 BUT if two classes are not related to each other, like Apple and Cloth classes, then we should create an interface
 for that like if we want to have a behavior of washAble.

Encapsulation:

Its protection, provide security, putting variables inside a capsule and display private field .
It is the 4th pillars of the OOPS, it provides security and better control over the data of a class.
We create classes and inside those classes, we create "private fields and methods".
The methods are called "getter and setter methods" and we set and get the values of the class fields with
the help of these methods instead of accessing and modifying them directly.

Eclipse Vs. Intellij

Eclipse = workspace
Intellij = Project

Eclipse = project
Intellij = Module
