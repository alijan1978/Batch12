Super Keyword:

Super is keyword like "this" keyword , but it refers to the parent class object.
We can use the super keyword in 3 different ways:

1. To access the super class variables, if we have name variables in super class and base class.
2. If we have same method names in parent and child class we can use the super keyword to access the parent
   class method, otherwise by default Java refers to the child class methods.
3. As constructors don't participate in Inheritance, we can use super( ) to call the constructor from the parent class.

Rules:
A- If we have a constructor in the parent class that takes 2 arguments, we must have a constructor inside the
    child class that at least takes those two arguments.
B- We can't use this( ) and super( ) inside the same constructor.
C- Super can't be used in Static methods.

Method Overloading in Java:

if we have same name methods in a class with different number of parameters or different sequence of parameters
or different data types of the parameters, it is called method overloading. Example:

class calculator{

add(int number, int number2){
  }
 add(int number, double number2){
  }
 add(int number, int number2, int number3){

  }
}
