Types of variables:

There are 3 types of variables: Local, Instance, and Static

Class Vars{
int age=10; //outside method, inside class... its called instance variable
double weight=25.5; //static variable

void method(){
String name="Moreed";// local variable , if it is inside method
}
}

1. local variables:
if a variable is defined inside a method or loop or switch or any other block of code, its called local variable.

2. Instance variables:
if a variable is not declared inside a method, but it is inside a class then it is called an instance variable.

3. Static variables:
if a variable is not declared inside a method, but it is inside a class and it has "Static Keyword" with it,
then it is called a Static variable.
---------------------------------------

When to use which type of variables:

- Local variables:
  should always be preferred over instance and static variables
  because they occupy the computer's memory for very short amount of time.
  As soon as their purpose is served, Java destroys them.
Pros:
    Save Memory
Cons:
    Not accessible outside of methods or block of code


- Instance variables:
  When we want to share something in multiple methods of a class and the information is expected
  to be different from object to object, then we should go with instance variables.

Pros:
    Accessible in all the methods of a class
Cons:
    Occupy the computers' memory for longer than local variables


- Static variables:
    When we know that information will stay the same for all the objects of a class,
    we should create a static variable for that.

Pros:
    Single memory location for all objects of a class
Cons:
    Stay longer in the memory.
    Can hold only one value at a time.
