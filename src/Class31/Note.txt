Maps -- > Its a data structure that allows us to store key value pairs.

Benefits:
1. Searching is efficient
2. We can use any types of keys like Double, String, Char, etc. We are not restricted to integer based natural indexes.

Retrieval means: Getting back the data from a data structure.
Natural Order: Ascending 0 - 9. or a - z from ASCII table order.
Thread Safety: mechanism to allow ONLY one thread access the data at a time
                for security purpose if there is multiple interesting thing in a data.


There are many types of Maps, BUT we will be discussing only 4 of them:
1. HashMap -- > 2. LinkedHashMap -- > 3. TreeMap -- > 4. HashTable (Old...not usually used)

1. HashMap:
-- HashMap is the fastest one when it comes to inserting and retrieving the data.
-- Insertion order is not maintained.
-- Most widely used Map
-- HashMap is not Thread Safe

2. LinkedHashMap:
-- LinkedHashMap maintains the insertion order.
-- Insertion speed is the same as HashMap.
-- Retrieval is the slowest one.

3. TreeMap:
-- Data is sorted based on the natural order.
-- Insertion is slowest because of the sorting.

4. HashTable:
-- It's a thread safe data means it can handle multiple insertions and retrievals at the same time from multiple
    CPU cores, But because of thread safety feature, it is also very slow. So if you are sure that you will never
    write multithreading code...so never use it.
-- HashTable is Thread Safe.
