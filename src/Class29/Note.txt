Recap on SET in Java:
===========================================================

Set is an interface in collections framework which is implemented by many classes.
For example: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeHashSet.

Properties of Set:
-   All the Sets don't allow duplications.

HashSet:
1. HashSet does not maintain the insertion order
2. It is the fastest in all Sets
3. Most widely used Set.

LinkedHashSet:
1. Maintains the insertion order
2. Slower than HashSet, but faster than TreeSet specially the insertions

TreeHashSet:
1. Sorts the data in natural order (for numbers to show increasing orders alphabetically as ASCII Table)
2. It is slowest when it comes to store the data.

When to use which type of Set??
-   If we don't care about insertion order and data being sorted, so always use HashSet.
-   If we need the insertion order, we (batch 12) don't have much choice.... we have to use the LinkedHashSet.
    BUt if we  dont care about insertion order, we can compare it with TreeSet.

-         LinkedHashSet           Vs.             TreeHashSet

         Insertion is not slow                   Slowest insertion
        Retrieval is super slow                  Slower than HashSet, but faster than LinkedHashSet

Questions:

I don't care about insertion order, but I care about retrieval speed which Set should I use?
*****  HashSet   *******

I care about insertion order, but I dont' care about retrieval speed which Set should I use?
*****  LinkedHashSet  *******

If I want to have sorted data all the time ?
 ****  TreeSet  ********
