Recap: Method Overloading in Java:

When same method name exists in a class, but with different name of parameters or different data type of
parameters OR different sequence of parameters.

Advantages of Method Overloading:

- End User gets the benefit that he does not need to remember different method names.
No Disadvantages in Method overloading.

Rules:
- We overload the constructors
- We can overload the static methods as well
- We can overload the main methods as well


Rules for Static Methods:

- Instance methods can access instance as well static fields directly
